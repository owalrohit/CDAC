Assignment 15

Using Subqueries with DML Commands.

1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions 
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one 
customer into this table. 

create table Multicust as select * from salespeople;
truncate multicust;

INSERT INTO Multicust (Snum, Sname, City, Comm) 
SELECT Snum, Sname, City, Comm  
FROM SALESPEOPLE  
WHERE Snum IN (SELECT Snum FROM CUSTOMERS GROUP BY Snum HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);



2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders. 


DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS  
WHERE Cnum NOT IN (SELECT Cnum FROM ORDERS); 


3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all 
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

UPDATE SALESPEOPLE  
SET Comm = Comm * 1.20  
WHERE Snum IN (SELECT Snum FROM ORDERS GROUP BY Snum HAVING SUM(Amt) > 3000);
