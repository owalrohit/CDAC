1) Write a query that will give you all orders for more than Rs. 1,000.   

SELECT * FROM ORDERS
WHERE Amt > 1000;

2) Write a query that will give you the names and cities of all salespeople in 
London with a commission above .10.  

SELECT sname, city FROM salespeople
WHERE city = 'London' AND comm > .10;


3) Write a query on the Customers table whose output will exclude all customers 
with a rating <= 100, unless they are located in Rome.   

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE (Rating > 100 OR City = 'Rome');

4) What will be the output from the following query?  
 
Select * from Orders      
where (amt < 1000 OR NOT (odate = ‘1990-10-03’ AND cnum > 2003)); 

Ans - it will print order records having amount less than 1000 excluding odate = ‘1990-10-03’ AND cnum > 2003


6) What is a simpler way to write this query?   

Select snum, sname, city, comm From Salespeople              
where (comm > .12 OR comm <.14);   

Select * From Salespeople              
where (comm > .12 OR comm <.14);
