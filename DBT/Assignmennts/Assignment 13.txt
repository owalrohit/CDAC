Using the UNION clause.


1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all 
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High 
Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”. 

select cname,city,rating,"High Rating" as status from customers where rating >= 200
union
select cname,city,rating,"Low Rating" as status from customers where rating < 200;


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and 
each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical 
order. 

SELECT Sname as name, Snum FROM SALESPEOPLE WHERE Snum IN (SELECT Snum FROM ORDERS GROUP BY
Snum HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
UNION
SELECT Cname as name, Cnum FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Cnum IN (SELECT Cnum FROM ORDERS GROUP BY
Cnum HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
ORDER BY name;



3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in 
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the 
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries 
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.  
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is 
besides the point.) 


SELECT Snum FROM SALESPEOPLE WHERE City = 'San Jose' 
UNION 
SELECT Cnum FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE City = 'San Jose' 
UNION ALL 
SELECT Onum FROM ORDERS WHERE Odate = '1990-10-03';
