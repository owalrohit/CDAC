Subqueries.

 1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named 
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum). 
*********************************************
select * from orders
where cnum IN
(select cnum from customers
where cname = "Cisneros");
*********************************************
mysql> select * from orders
    -> where cnum IN
    -> (select cnum from customers
    -> where cname = "Cisneros");
Empty set (0.01 sec)

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have above-average orders. 

SELECT cname, rating
FROM customers
WHERE cnum IN (
    SELECT cnum
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY cnum
    HAVING COUNT(onum) > (
        SELECT AVG(order_count)
        FROM (
            SELECT COUNT(onum) AS order_count
            FROM orders
            GROUP BY cnum
        ) AS avg_orders
    )
);


3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for 
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table. 

select snum,sum(amt) "total_amount" from orders
group by snum
having total_amount >
(select max(amt) from orders);
