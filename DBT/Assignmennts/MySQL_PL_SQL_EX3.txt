Exercise 3 
  
1. Write a program containing a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000 using a variable I,                         
which is incremented each time around the loop. The program should output the 
value of I every hundred iterations (i.e., the output should be 100, 200, etc.).    

	
create procedure aa()
begin
declare num int default 1;
while num<=1000 do
	if mod(num,100)=0 then
		insert into output values (num,'value');
	end if;
	set num=num+1;
end while;
end;//


2. Write a program that examines all the numbers from 1 to 999, displaying all those 
for which the sum of the cubes of the digits equal the number itself.   


create procedure aa1()
begin 
declare x default 1;
while x <= 99 do
if x*x*x =





3. Write a program that Selects from any table a minimum and maximum value for a 
radius, along with an increment factor, and generates a series of radii by repeatedly 
adding the increment to the minimum until the maximum is reached. For each value 
of the radius, compute and display the circumference, area, and volume of the 
sphere. (Be sure to include both the maximum and the minimum values.).   












4. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and backward, such as 
level, radar, etc. Write a program to Selects from any table a five letter word and 
determine whether it is a palindrome.    
















5. Modify the above program to Select from any table a variable length word. This 
requires determining how many characters are read in.
